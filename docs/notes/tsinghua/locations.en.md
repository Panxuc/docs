## Accommodation

### Zijing Student Apartment

Zijing Student Apartments were built in the early 21st century. There is a parking floor for bicycles downstairs in the apartment building for undergraduate students. There are up to 7 floors and there is no elevator. If you live in a high-rise building, it is recommended to ask parents or classmates to help carry large luggage.

There are 4 students in each dormitory, and the two dormitories share a central hall. There is a large table in the middle hall, and there is a small wall-mounted closet. In the hall, suitcases are usually placed, and bedding that is not used can be placed in the closet. There are beds in the dormitory (only bed boards are provided, with tables on and off the bed), fluorescent lamps, air conditioners, radiators, lockers, and benches. There is wireless network coverage in the dormitory building, and there are wired network ports and network cables under the desks. Desk lamps, computer chairs, mosquito nets and other items can be purchased by yourself, or you can participate in group purchases after school starts. Each dormitory has a balcony (but not necessarily facing south) and clothes rails (higher, it is recommended to buy clothes forks). The dormitories are more spacious. It is recommended to buy water dispensers and mineral water for school purchases.

On average, every ten dormitories has a washroom (bathroom + washbasin, the washbasin may not have hot water, if necessary, you can get hot water from the water dispenser), a toilet, and one or two washrooms on each floor with washing machines, laundry facilities, etc. Shoe machine, water dispenser (both hot and cold water). If you use a washing machine to do laundry, please put a bucket or basin next to it, so that you can take it out and put it away when the next classmate comes to use it. Each bathroom has three nozzles, the space is not large, and there is no blocking. Hot water for bathing is provided from 7:00 am to 9:00 am and from 5:00 pm to 12:00 pm.

Every two dormitories share an electric meter. Undergraduate students have 8 kilowatt-hours of free electricity per month. If it exceeds, students need to negotiate and recharge the electricity bill. Do not use high-power electrical appliances exceeding 1000W, otherwise it will cause tripping. From 0:00 to 6:00, the lights and power will be turned off. During this period, the lights and sockets in the dormitory cannot be used. In order to facilitate the use of air conditioners in summer, the lights and power will not be turned off from mid-May to early October; if the next day is a holiday or during the exam week, the lights and power will not be turned off.

You need to swipe your student card to enter and exit the apartment building. The apartment building has one gate accessible 24 hours, with the remaining gates open during peak times of the day. The student card can only be used to enter your own dormitory building. To enter the dormitory building of other students, you need to register with the dormitory management office. A key is required to enter the dormitory. If the key is accidentally lost, you can go to the general service desk of the student dormitory in Building C with your ID card and other valid documents to mortgage and borrow a spare key.

Zijing Apartment is relatively close to some canteens (Tao Li Yuan, Zijing Yuan, Yushu Yuan, Zhilan Yuan), express delivery points, Zijing Playground, Student Community Management Service Center (Building C), Tmall Supermarket, etc.

### South District Student Apartment

The student apartments in the South District have been built or refurbished in recent years. Compared with the Zijing Apartment, the facilities in the South District apartment are relatively new, with elevators, hot water for washing, etc., the access control supports face recognition, the corridor lighting conditions are better, and the dormitories are mainly three-person rooms. However, apartments in the South District do not have a central hall, and the dormitories are relatively small, and some dormitories do not have individual balconies. The rest of the facilities are similar to those of Zijing Apartment.

Some of the public areas are located in Southside Apartments. For example, Textbook Service Center (on the side of the North Building, Building 10, South District), College Management Center (Building 10, South District), and Student Activity Center (Ground Floor, Building 10, South District).

Apartments in the South District are relatively close to some canteens (Qingfen Yuan, Guanchou Yuan), libraries, most teaching buildings, and the east playground.

## Diet

Tsinghua University has a large number of canteens and rich dishes, and different canteens have their own characteristics. The main canteens include:

- **Regular Student Canteen** Guanchou Yuan (commonly known as Ten Thousand People Canteen), Taoli Yuan, Zijing Yuan, Qingfen Yuan, Yushu Yuan, Tingtao Yuan, Zhilan Yuan, Dingxiang Yuan, He Yuan
- **A la carte restaurant** Jinchun Yuan, Taoli Yuan (third floor), Guanchou Yuan (third floor), Dufeng Academy
- **Casual fast food restaurant** Qingqing Fast Food (Ground Floor of Qingfen Yuan), Qingqing Pizza (Ground Ground of Zijing Yuan), Taoli Yuan (Ground Floor)

Among them, the student canteen is suitable for daily meals, and restaurants and fast food restaurants are suitable for meeting with classmates. Generally speaking, you can eat well in general canteens for around 14 yuan, and those who pursue low prices can eat for around 7 yuan or even less (the second and third floors of Zijing, less big meat types). Some canteens cost around 20 yuan.

Most of the windows that separate vegetables and rice are in units of "liang", which is generally considered to refer to the weight of raw rice. For regular boys, two taels are just right, and three taels are full. The rice of Qingfen 2nd layer and Zijing 4th layer comes in bowls of different sizes, just watch the amount on the spot.

I recommend the following Tsinghua specialties: school-produced yogurt and sour plum soup (available in most cafeterias), spicy hot pot (can benot spicy, available in most cafeterias), instant-boiled mutton (Guanchou Yuan, Zijing Yuan), stilted beef (Tao Li Yuan 2nd floor), Beef Noodles and Chicken Noodles (Tingtao Yuan 2nd Floor Qingqing Niu La, Qingfen Yuan), Hand Cake and Roasted Cold Noodles (Tao Li Yuan), Teppanyaki Rice (Guan Chou Yuan, Tao Li Yuan), Cantonese-style rice rolls (Guanchou Yuan, Dingxiang Yuan), Hainan Chicken Rice (Zijing Yuan), hot dry noodles (Tingtao Yuan), grilled fish (Taoli Yuan 3rd floor), etc.

Generally speaking, the canteen can only use the campus card for consumption, and other payment methods cannot be used. Some canteens (such as the second floor of Yushuyuan) order food machines, and you can use mobile phones to pay.

## Travel

### School Activities

Tsinghua University has a large campus, and bicycles are generally required for on-campus activities (if you don’t know how to ride a bicycle, it is strongly recommended to learn it in summer vacation). Bicycles can be purchased on campus after enrollment.

It is not recommended to buy a car that is too extravagant, nor is it recommended to buy a car that is too cheap, otherwise the car skeleton structure and spokes may be unstable. Cycling on campus is relatively safe, there are few cars, just pay attention to avoiding other bicycles and pedestrians. (Note, you must remember to lock your bicycle when you park it, otherwise the security office may soon need to find your bicycle for you) It is not recommended to ride a bicycle in a hurry when the roads are icy in winter. There are car repair shops downstairs in some dormitories, and there is a large car repair booth in the open space to the north of Qingfen Yuan.

About ten minutes before the start of class, the two major north-south arterial roads in the school have a particularly heavy traffic flow, especially in the teaching area (near the three teaching and six teaching areas), and even bicycle traffic jams can occur. This phenomenon is especially serious in the first few weeks before the school starts. It is recommended to Depart for class at least twenty minutes in advance for two weeks.

In addition to bicycles, there are also campus buses on campus, which are free for students with a student ID card. You can check the specific route and real-time location of the bus on the WeChat mini-program "Tsinghua Campus Bus". But generally not commonly used.

The popular visiting check-in spots on campus are: Second School Gate, Sundial, Great Hall, I-shaped Hall, Shuimu Tsinghua University, Lotus Pond, Jinchun Yuan Ruins, Lover’s Slope, Main Building, Library, Art Museum, School History Museum, etc.

### Out of school activities

When going out of campus by subway, it is recommended to ride to the west gate and walk or share a bicycle to Yuanmingyuan subway station, or park at the parking spot near Wudaokou subway station. Places for leisure and sightseeing near the school include: Old Summer Palace, Summer Palace, Wudaokou Shopping Center, Peking University, etc. It is recommended to use tools such as Gaode map flexibly and download the map of Beijing offline.

There are subway lines 4 and 13 near the school, and you can easily and quickly reach various scenic spots and leisure and entertainment places in Beijing through the subway. The subway stations near the school, and the route from the subway station to the dormitory area are as follows:

- **Yuanmingyuan Station** It is recommended to go out from Exit C (exit at the northeast corner, you will be at the gate of Yuanmingyuan) and go east along the street until you reach the West Gate of Tsinghua University. Enter the west gate and continue to the east through the second school gate to reach the New Tsinghua School (brick-red circular auditorium-style building with a large square at the entrance and a square building school history museum next to it), turn left, and walk along Xuetang Road until passing Sanjiao and Wentu , Qingfen Yuan, and South District Dormitory to reach the Zijing Dormitory Area.
- **Qinghua East Road West Exit Station** After exiting the station, you can use shared bicycles or call a taxi to go to the Northeast Gate. Enter the Northeast Gate and walk a little to the right, which is the Zijing dormitory area. Although it is the only subway station with Tsinghua in its name, it is inconvenient to enter the school because Tsinghua lacks a common school gate in the middle of the east side, and there is no shade and less crowded areas such as departments and laboratories on the east side of the campus. In addition, outside the school The road on the east side is twisted due to the subway, so it is not recommended to walk to the school by yourself.
- **Wudaokou Station** Choose carefully in the evening peak, with limited traffic and many people. It is recommended to go out from the north gate, walk west to the intersection between CP Lotus Supermarket and Tsinghua Science and Technology Park, turn right, and go straight to the main school gate of the southeast gate (some people call it the east gate). The entrance of the main school is directly opposite to the main building, and there are roads going north on both sides, and you can reach the dormitory area by walking north along the road. It is recommended to take the road on the west side of the main building, which has more shade;
- **Peking University East Gate Station** is the closest to the South Gate of Tsinghua University. You can go out and walk north to the West Gate of Tsinghua University, or you can go east along the gate of the School of Physics of Peking University until you reach the South Gate of Tsinghua University (a very small gate) and enter. A few kilometers to the north, you can reach the Zijing dormitory area. In comparison, it is recommended to take one more stop to Yuanmingyuan Station.
