**2. Professional Direction**

The undergraduate major of the Department of Electronic Engineering is electronic information science and technology.

Based on mathematics and physics, electronic information science and technology conducts in-depth research on the basic laws of information carriers and information processing systems, as well as the interaction between the two. From the design and manufacture of microelectronics and optoelectronic devices to the construction of complex information systems such as communications, radar, and artificial intelligence, electronic information science and technology have fully penetrated into various fields such as medical care, transportation, energy, and the environment, and have become the key drivers of the national economy, military and national defense. It is an important force to develop and support the country's political and economic life in other fields. The undergraduate teaching of the Department of Electronics adopts an optimized curriculum system, has a multidisciplinary teaching and research environment, and has obvious advantages in the fields of cutting-edge science and applied technology.

## [Undergraduate Curriculum System](https://www.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/zsjx/bks/bkskctx.htm)

The Department of Electronic Engineering adheres to the undergraduate education concept of "wide caliber and solid foundation", pays attention to professional adaptability and subject expansion, and is oriented to the three ones of "electronic science and technology", "information and communication engineering", and "integrated circuit science and engineering". It focuses on the comprehensive development of students' knowledge, ability and quality. The teaching method of "core concept-knowledge system" is proposed, and a new knowledge system and curriculum system are constructed.

The core concept running through "information" and "electronics" is "interaction between information carrier and system". The professional knowledge of related disciplines can be condensed into "field and charge carrier", "electric potential and circuit", "bit and logic", "program and processor", "data and algorithm", "data packet and network", "media and Cognition" and other seven-level progressive knowledge systems.

Based on this concise and clear knowledge system, the Department of Electronics has established 10 professional core courses, and at the same time set up a self-development elective course group consisting of professional and experimental limited courses, undergraduate and research-through professional courses, and cross-department elective courses. The professional core courses covering the electronic information knowledge system have laid a broad and solid professional foundation for students, and the rich self-development courses have broadened students' vision and thinking, and opened up a broad space for students' own interests and employment expectations.

In order to comprehensively improve the comprehensive quality of students, the "Student Research Training" (Student Research Training, SRT) topic is provided every year, which provides opportunities for students to directly enter the professor's laboratory to participate in scientific research training.

## [Employment Status](https://www.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/zsjx/jyqk.htm)

The Department of Electronic Engineering of Tsinghua University has a total of 421 fresh graduates in 2021. The ratio of undergraduate, master and doctoral graduates is about 4 : 2 : 1. The main employment industries are private enterprises related to electronic information technology, state-owned enterprises, and university research institutes. From 2017 to The employment rate in the past five years in 2021 will be above 97% (Note: Employment rate = (contracted employment + domestic and foreign advanced studies + flexible employment) / total number of graduates).

The proportion of undergraduates studying in the Department of Electronics is no less than 85%. Due to the new crown epidemic and changes in the international situation, the proportion of undergraduates studying abroad dropped from 40.5% in 2018 to 14.5% in 2021, while the proportion of domestic students rose from 42.8% in 2018 to 72.6%, of which domestic institutions of higher learning mainly include Tsinghua University (the school’s graduate school), major research institutes of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Peking University, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Zhejiang University, etc. Overseas institutions for advanced study mainly include University of Illinois, Univ California, Stanford Univ, Natl Univ Singapore, Massachusetts Inst Tech (MIT), Princeton Univ, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich, Tokyo Univ, etc.
